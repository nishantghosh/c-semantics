# Status of C18 support

C18 (also called C17) does not add any new features to C11, but it does
incorporate changes and clarifications suggested in the following Defect
Reports (DRs). For details, see:

  * [The last C18 public draft.](https://web.archive.org/web/20181230041359if_/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/abq/c17_proposed_fdis.pdf)
  * [A list of incorporated PRs](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2244.htm) (marked C17), which is reproduced below.

Below we outline whether a change was required to our semantics of C11 to
incorporate the wording of a DR and what changes those were in each case.

## Notes

  1. No change required: DR concerns a feature or part of the C11 standard which
     our C11 semantics did not cover, e.g., the preprocessor, much of the
     standard library, and optional extensions. In the future, if we model this
     feature with our semantics, we will incorporate this DR.

  2. No change required: We have very limited support for multi-threaded
     programs and the C/C++11 shared memory consistency model. In the future,
     when we implement the C/C++11 memory consistency model, we will incorporate
     this DR.

  3. No change required: DR wording has little or no normative impact (such as a
     typo fix) and requires no change to our project.

  4. No change required: DR concerns the preprocessor, which is not modeled by
     our semantics.

  5. Change required: added a check for the implementation-defined behavior
     resulting from passing a zero size to `realloc` (as well as `malloc`,
     `calloc`, and `aligned_alloc`).

  6. Change required: because we reference the items listed in Appendix J
     (portability issues) by the order in which they appear, we need to update
     references to this appendix with the new ordinals.

  7. No change required: We have very limited support for `stdatomic.h`. In the
     future, when we implement these features, we will incorporate this DR.

  8. Change required: changes were made to our semantics of casting values to
     qualified types. The type of such expressions is the unqualified type.

  9. No change required: updated wording perhaps has normative impact or
     resolves some ambiguity, but conforms to our interpretation of the
     standard.

  10. Change required: semantics of alignment.

  11. Change required: effective type of objects with a temporary lifetime.

  12. Change required: semantics of `aligned_alloc` were updated to allow
      unsupported alignments to result in returning a null pointer and no
      undefined behavior.

  13. Change required: The semantics of calculating the type of the controlling
      expression in a generic selection were updated.
